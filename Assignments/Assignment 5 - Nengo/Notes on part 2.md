# Run Neurons

The below code links back to the the book [HtBaB](Resources/How_to_Build_a_Brain.pdf) page 396
```python
dV = dt * (input[i] - v[i]) / t_rc Â # the LIF voltage change equation
v[i] += dV
```

- $V(t)$ is `v`
- $J(x)$ is the `input`
- $\tau_{RC}$ is the membrane RC time constant, in this case its $dt=0.02$   
- $R$ is disregarded in this case
- Note that there is a minus infront of the equation but not the `python` function. 
	- hence the reversed subtraction

The rest of the if functions it that function are self explanatory.

# Compute Responses

```python
    # compute input corresponding to x
    input = []
    for i in range(N):
        input.append(x * encoder[i] * gain[i] + bias[i])
        v[i] = np.random.uniform(0, 1)  # randomize the initial voltage level
```
The code above likely links back to the following formula in the book [HtBaB](Resources/How_to_Build_a_Brain.pdf) page 396
