## files in this map

The files are stored **two ways**: as the .lisp and as a .md with the code quoted. Run the .lisp in ACT-r, use the .md to read in obsidian.
- [[Broken addition (original)]]the broken-addition.lisp is the original faulty file that has to be fixed.
- [[Fixed addition - Matthijs]] the broken-addition-Matthijs-copy.lisp is a fixed version that runs correctly (has not been graded)
