## Concolution

- overlay human reponse signal over box plots. 
- Because its unrealistic that stimulus response 
- this is the reason for the types of responses we actually get from the brain 

### Finally
- model predictions and data has peak width and height similarities

## Exam Question
- Very similar exam question
- explained cognitive and assciative
	- 5$3=?
	- 5$3=5+4+3=12
- prefrontal cortex and motor cortex
- prefrontal: if you have a higher peak the points wehre it comes down happens later
- motor: they will overlap but no difference in dificulty, one curve for all three

## Behavioural Results

- the more cognitive transformations that you need to do the longer the delay
- from the experiment we could conclude that Transformations and Substitutions are two separate modular functions in the brain.

From the image below:

- You would not expect `visual data` to be here
- but when you look at the exanded graphs
![[Pasted image 20241121113857.png]]
- activity with visual input and vocal response;
- when you say it out loud, you are hearing your voice
- auditory much lower in activity

### Imaginal and Retrieval 

- Imaginal: Parietal
- Retrieval: Prefrontal cortex
- There is trend here for modulariy but not as distinct.
- during a task, both regions/tasks have to happen. Storing, imagining.

### Can we simulate the human brain with a Model
 **Model perception for aural**
 - need to know why the curves are shifted after the delay 
 - so the models in the slides are really accurate to what we would observe in the real world.

## What is a good model

- Functional criteria
	- had to show intelligent behaviour appropriate for the task
- Behavioural criteria 
	- perform task same as human
- Neurophysiological criteria
	- has to represent what happens in the brain
		- neural netwroks/ representations
		- able to predict brain activity
## Assignment 
- when we have less than 4 dots we do subitizing. its like counting without counting. we do it subconsiously. could use finsts to represent this. 

- comparing the model with human data
	- correlations
	- deviation (root mean squared deviation)
		- she went on a little rant about why we use Root-Mean-Squared Deviation
- `correlation does not imply causation`

### Data Fitting

- models need to fit human data.
- make statements on the fit of the model with the human data
- automatic parameter fitting needs to be cognitively plausible
